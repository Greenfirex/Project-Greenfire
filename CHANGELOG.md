This is the initial non public release of Project Greenfire. This version establishes the core gameplay mechanics, a polished user interface, and a variety of customization options.

### âœ¨ New Features

- **Core Gameplay:** Implemented the foundational gameplay loop for resource gathering, building construction, and technology research.
- **Building System:** Added a variety of buildings, including resource producers (Quarry, Extractor), storage facilities (Stockpile, Silo), and the Laboratory.
- **Cost Scaling:** Building costs now increase exponentially with each purchase, creating a balanced progression curve.
- **Research System:** A full technology tree with prerequisites and resource costs has been implemented, unlocking new game features.
- **Advanced Tooltips:** Hovering over a resource in the info panel now shows a detailed breakdown of its production rate, including base generation from buildings and percentage bonuses from research.
