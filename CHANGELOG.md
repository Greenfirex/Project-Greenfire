# [0.1.7] - 2025-10-31

- Added: Two‚Äëstage ‚ÄúSearch: Power Core‚Äù. Stage 1 reports reinforced doors; Stage 2 requires and consumes 1 Makeshift Explosive, then opens the core and yields rewards. Stage‚Äëspecific costs now supported in UI and engine.
- Added: New resources ‚Äî Chemicals and Makeshift Explosive (hidden until discovered).
- Added: Repeatable ‚ÄúCollect Chemicals‚Äù action (unlocked by Labs).
- Added: ‚ÄúAssemble Makeshift Explosive‚Äù craft action. Auto‚Äëunlocks when both Fabric and Chemicals are discovered (via centralized unlock rules).
- Added: Upgrade ‚ÄúInstall Purification Unit‚Äù (+20% Clean Water from Purify Water; +20% Water Collection job). Unlocks after ‚ÄúSearch: Labs‚Äù.
- Added: Central upgrade effects system (upgradeEffects.js) with:
  - computeRewardMultiplier and computeRewardEffects (math + labels).
  - Tooltips now use the same function as runtime, so previews match actual rewards.
- Added: Centralized block/unlock rules (unlockRules.js):
  - getBlockedStatus for action gating (e.g., corridors/bridge require Investigate Sound + Base Camp).
  - evaluateEventUnlocks for resource‚Äëbased unlocks (e.g., Fabric + Chemicals ‚ûú Assemble Explosive).
- Added: actionUtils.js with documented helpers (pure, stateless): stage merge for tooltips, affordability/shortfalls, effective duration (debuffs), RNG, lsGet.

- Changed: Tooltips are stage‚Äëaware (show stage.cost like Makeshift Explosive on Power Core stage 2; stage duration/reward overrides).
- Changed: North corridor story updated to point to Labs + Power Core, survivor is sent back to base, and hints that restoring core power would boost search & rescue.
- Changed: Generic completion logging is now opt‚Äëout via suppressGenericLog on actions or stages (used by Establish Base Camp, Purification Unit installs).

- Fixed: Power Core stage 2 properly blocked without Makeshift Explosive and shows correct tooltip cost; cost is consumed on start.
- Fixed: Purify Water and Clean Water job tooltips reflect the Purification Unit‚Äôs +20% bonus.
- Fixed: Removed duplicate green ‚Äúcomplete/gained‚Äù log for actions that set suppressGenericLog.

- Refactor: Split Upgrade actions into data/upgrades.js and added data/allActions.js aggregator; updated imports (Crash Site, Colony, Save/Load).
- Refactor: crashSite.js trimmed; shared helpers moved to actionUtils.js; removed duplicate getRandomInt; resource‚Äëdiscovery unlocks and action blocking now delegated to unlockRules.js.
- Refactor: tooltip.js aligned to upgradeEffects (removed hard‚Äëcoded cases; unused helpers trimmed).

# [0.1.5] - 2025-10-29

- **Added:** Tooltip ETA ‚Äî tooltips now show estimated time-to-availability (ETA) for missing resources when there is a positive net production for that resource.
- **Added:** Tooltip missing-cost highlighting ‚Äî cost/drain lines that the player is short on are highlighted in red for immediate clarity.
- **Added:** Tooltip auto-refresh ‚Äî tooltips now refresh in-place every 1s while visible so ETAs and live rates stay up-to-date.
- **Added:** Tooltip API ‚Äî exported refreshCurrentTooltip() so modules can force an immediate tooltip rebuild after resource changes.
- **Added:** Crash Site action-state updater ‚Äî action affordances are recalculated each main-loop tick so buttons reflect real-time resource changes.

- **Changed:** Tooltip rendering refactor ‚Äî moved tooltip HTML generation into a single build function used for initial render and refresh.
- **Changed:** Tooltip positioning ‚Äî chosen screen coordinates are persisted on first layout and reused while refreshing to avoid jumps.
- **Changed:** Resource display logic ‚Äî per-second generation only shows when there is a non-zero production/consumption (avoids "0.0/s" noise) and uses explicit +/- formatting.
- **Changed:** Scrap Metal resource flagged as non-producible by default to match Food/Clean Water layout and prevent misalignment.
- **Changed:** Action/button behavior ‚Äî stopped using native title attributes for shortfall/blocked messages; messages are stored in data-* attributes and shown via the custom tooltip.

- **Fixed:** Removed duplicate native tooltip by stripping title attributes and observing mutations on registered tooltip elements.
- **Fixed:** Prevented duplicate small tooltips by suppressing resource-row candidates while a non-resource tooltip is active.
- **Fixed:** Debuff icons no longer register their own tooltip and are non-interactive so they don't steal hover.
- **Fixed:** Tooltip refresh robustness ‚Äî auto-refresh now persists while the tooltip is visible and stops cleanly on hide.
- **Fixed:** Immediate tooltip updates ‚Äî refreshCurrentTooltip() calls added to action/building/job handlers so tooltips update right after costs/rewards/refunds are applied.
- **Fixed:** Action click handlers recompute affordability/blocked state on click (no stale closures) so log messages and prevention are reliable.

- **Notes:** ETA calculations use computeResourceRates() for live netPerSecond values. The tooltip refresher is lightweight and defensive (swallows errors) to avoid impacting the main loop. If you want additional modules wired to refreshCurrentTooltip or different refresh frequency, indicate target files and desired cadence.

# [0.1.1] - 2025-10-25

- Fix: debuff icon tooltip reliably shows (hit-test priority, direct icon handlers) and properly transitions icon ‚Üî row without races.
- Fix: removed stray event handlers and runtime errors that prevented tooltip logic from running.
- Change: tooltip hide is triggered when story popups open (dispatches request-hide-tooltip).
- UI: story popup is now a fixed-size dialog with a scrollable content area so Next/Previous buttons do not move; dialog size increased (~50% larger).
- UX: added Esc key support to close story popup; handler is attached when popup opens and removed on close.
- Style: popup navigation uses the shared menu-button styling and buttons constrained to ~20% width for consistent layout.
- Misc: removed temporary debug helpers (TIME_SCALE) and trimmed nonessential tooltip workarounds while keeping minimal, robust fixes.

# [0.1.0] - 2025-10-22
