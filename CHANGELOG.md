# [0.1.0] - 2025-10-22

This update introduces the foundational elements of **Chapter 1: Fall From the Sky**, shifting the game's start to a narrative-driven survival scenario before the colony-building phase. It also includes various quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes based on initial development.

### ‚ú® New Features

- **Chapter 1 Implemented:** The game now begins at a crash site. Players start as a lone survivor and must explore, scavenge, and manage basic needs before establishing a colony.
- **New "Crash Site" Section:** Replaces the initial "Colony" view as the starting area. Features unique actions focused on survival and salvaging.
- **New Survival Mechanics:**
    - **Energy Resource:** Added a new resource required for performing most actions. Drains over time during strenuous tasks.
    - **Food Rations & Clean Water Costs:** Actions now consume Food and Water directly, representing the player's personal needs.
    - **New Survival Actions:** Added "Rest" (restores Energy), "Forage for Food", and "Purify Water".
- **New Salvage & Exploration Mechanics:**
    - **New Resources:** Added "Scrap Metal" and "Ship Components" gathered from the wreckage.
    - **Multi-Stage Scouting:** The "Scout Surroundings" action is now a three-stage quest that progressively unlocks survival and scavenging actions and reveals story elements via unique, clickable log entries.
- **Action Categories:** Actions in the Crash Site are now organized into "Survival", "Materials", "Exploration", and "Objectives".
- **In-Game Time:** A clock displaying the current time has been added to the header.
- **Encrypted Save Export/Import:** Added functionality in the **Options** menu to export and import saves securely.

### üîÑ Changes & Improvements

    - Actions can now have costs paid upfront (`cost`) or drained over time (`drain`).

    - Action progress bars are now displayed inside the action button, including a countdown timer.
    - Actions in progress can now be cancelled with a two-click confirmation ("Abort?"), refunding 50% of spent/drained resources.

        - Improved layout for resource rows (slimmer height, adjusted column spacing, text forced to single line).
        - Non-producible resources (Scrap, Components, Energy, etc.) no longer show a `/s` rate and have adjusted layouts.

        - Resources at zero amount now display their name and amount in **red**.
        - "Insight" resource text is now **yellow**.
        - Tooltips for resources now provide a detailed breakdown including Production, Consumption, Drain, and Net Change.
    - **Tooltips:**
        - Tooltips for Crash Site actions now display duration, costs (upfront and total drain), and reward ranges.
    - **Crash Site:** Added a full-section semi-transparent content panel to improve text readability over the background image.
    - **Story Log:** Log entries for completing scouting stages are now unique and **clickable**, allowing players to revisit the story popups.
    - **Footer:** Correctly implemented the three-column layout with consistent glowing dividers.
- **Progression:**
    - Game start significantly reworked around the Chapter 1 narrative.
    - Resources like Stone, Scrap, and Components are now **hidden** until discovered/acquired.
    - Survivor count starts at `0` and is hidden initially.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed numerous issues related to saving and loading game state, particularly regarding multi-stage action progress (**Scout Surroundings**).
- Resolved CSS conflicts and layout problems in the footer and info panel (text wrapping, inconsistent row heights).
- Fixed JavaScript errors related to module exports (`showSection`) and incorrect variable references during action completion.
- Corrected tooltip display logic to reliably differentiate between actions and technologies.
