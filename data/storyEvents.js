        "You are the commander of the remote mining colony on Telos-IV. Your mission is simple: expand operations, extract resources, and survive.",
        "Suddenly, alarms blare. A previously undetected object has appeared in high orbit, its trajectory an impossible, direct line towards the colony. It's glowing with an unnatural green aura.",
        "There is no time to prepare. The impact is imminent... the world goes white, then silent. You, your colony, everything... is gone.",
        "...and then you wake up at your command console, the same alarms blaring. A chilling sense of déjà vu washes over you as you frantically check the sensor logs. Nothing. No object, no impact warning. Was it all a dream?",
        "But the feeling is too real. Your gut tells you it wasn't a dream. Trusting this strange instinct, you recalibrate the deep space sensors, pushing them far beyond their standard limits. And then you see it. A massive object, light-years away, its energy signature faint but identical. It's real, and it's coming."
